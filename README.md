# LEDmatrix

A 10 * 20 Pixel LED Matrix

Run the server:
	`python3 server/driver.py`

Run the client:
	`python3 -m client`

The serial paths are hardcoded for now.
So remember to boot the orange pi with the arduino plugged in,
wait a minute and only then plug in the HES controller (it all Just Worksâ„¢)
